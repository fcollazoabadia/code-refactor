# Code Refactor

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The purpose of this code refactor was to fix any bugs, clean up the CSS, as well as edit and add semantic elements.
- The code was refactored to provide greater accessability and to clean up CSS styling.
- Fixed an issue with the SEO link.
- Added a title to the HTML file.
- Consolidated lines of code in the CSS file.
- In the process I familiarized myself with some of the many semnatic element tags and their uses, as well as how to troubleshoot issues when they arose as a result of editing the starter code.
